# Geographic-Data-Analysis

This is a sample notebook that displays some basic EDA for a couple datasets.
The local data set has to do with voting election data from 2012
Global data on power consumption in KWH

All plots are made with interactive plotly library which makes for excellent summary of data at the point of a cursor.
Very interesting and useful library.
